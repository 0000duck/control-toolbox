 * \ingroup GNMS
 *
 * C++ implementation of GNMS. In fact, this currently implements iLQR.
 *
 * The implementation and naming is based on the reference below. In general, the code follows this convention:
 * X  <- Matrix (upper-case in paper)
 * xv <- vector (lower-case bold in paper)
 * x  <- scalar (lower-case in paper)
